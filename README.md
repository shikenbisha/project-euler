This is my solutions to [project-euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

## problem001

- [problem001.rb](./problem001.rb)
    
    I used the sum fomula from 1 to n.
     ```
    1 + ... + n  = n * (n+1) / 2
     ```
    I practice  writing a program , without using "for" stupidly.

- [problem001_another.rb](./problem001_another.rb)
    
    I was surprised at the fact you can write  this solution on a single line by "method chain" !

## problem002

- [problem002.rb](./problem002.rb)

  I learned how to define of recursive functions.

## problem003

- [problem003.rb](./problem003.rb)

  By "Prime.each" and "select" , you can take the prime factors of the number.

## problem004

- [problem004.rb](./problem004.rb)

  Oh, "reverse" ...

## problem005

- [problem005.rb](./problem005.rb)
  
   
  I calculated the power of each prime factor, less than 20,\
  and multiplied them . 

## problem006



## problem007

  ```
    t = 3
    a + t
  ```

- foo-bar
